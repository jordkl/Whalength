Kinda butchered the original code if I'm honest. Replaced TinyGPS Library with NeoGPS and fixed a few things that prevented data from being written to the SD card. Please use at your own risk!

If v6 is not starting please download the 'private' folder from the repository as this was not included in the .zip files. Please paste it into the folder that contains the 'whalength.m' file.

The bug in the 5% width calculation has been fixed in version 6.

To correct any previous 5% width measurements made in version 5 you can use these conversion factors for the 3 different systems. Each conversion factor was generated by measuring over 200 known lengths with both v5 and v6 (for a range of locations and orientations within  the image). The mean of the conversion factor between each of these measurements is given below for each system. Please use these to multiply any 5% width measurements made with the version 5 GUI (except for I1P photos) to get the correct widths.

I1P stills:
1.1994 (range 1.1890-1.2097, standard deviation = 0.0040)  

I2P photos:
0.8728 (range: 0.8659-0.8794, standard deviation = 0.0019) 

I2P stills:
1.2007 (range: 1.1950-1.2066, Standard deviation = 0.0019)


All other measurements (total length, widths etc), and any measurements for the I1P photo system were unaffected by this bug and do not need to be corrected.
